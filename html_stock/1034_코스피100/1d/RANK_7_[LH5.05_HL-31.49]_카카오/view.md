# Customization

Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for
MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful. However, as you
write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are
necessary to preserve your brand's style.

## Adding assets

[MkDocs] provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few
small tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add CSS and JavaScript files to
the `docs` directory.
