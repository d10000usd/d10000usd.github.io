PROMPT:

df\['Count\_U'\] = df.apply(lambda row: row.str.count('U').sum(), axis=1) df\['Count\_D'\] = df.apply(lambda row: row.str.count('D').sum(), axis=1) df\[sum\] = 코드

RESPONSE:

It seems like you're trying to calculate the count of 'U' and 'D' in each row of a DataFrame and add those counts as new columns. However, there seems to be a syntax error in your code, specifically in the line where you're trying to add the sum of the counts as a new column. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

df['Count_U'] = df.apply(lambda row: row.str.count('U').sum(), axis=1)
df['Count_D'] = df.apply(lambda row: row.str.count('D').sum(), axis=1)
df['Sum'] = df['Count_U'] + df['Count_D']
```

In the above code, the first two lines calculate the count of 'U' and 'D' in each row using lambda functions with `apply()`. The counts are then assigned to the 'Count\_U' and 'Count\_D' columns, respectively.

The third line creates a new column named 'Sum' by adding the 'Count\_U' and 'Count\_D' columns together. Note that you should replace `[sum]` with a valid column name (e.g., `'Sum'`) to assign the sum to a column in the DataFrame.

Make sure you have imported the pandas library (`import pandas as pd`) before executing this code.
