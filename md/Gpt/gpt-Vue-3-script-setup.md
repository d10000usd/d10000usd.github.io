Sure, here's your Vue 3 script portion converted to use the `<script setup>` syntax:

```vue
<script setup>
import { Chart, FundamentalData, ForexHeatMap, CompanyProfile, Screener, CryptoMarket } from "vue-tradingview-widgets";
import { defineProps, ref } from 'vue';

const props = defineProps({
  message: String,
});

const selectedOption = ref("BTCUSDT");

const studies = [
  "ROC@tv-basicstudies",
  "StochasticRSI@tv-basicstudies",
  "MASimple@tv-basicstudies"
];

const CryptoMarket_options = {
  width: 1000,
  height: 490,
  defaultColumn: "moving_averages",
  screener_type: "crypto_mkt",
  displayCurrency: "USD",
  colorTheme: "light",
  locale: "kr"
};

const FundamentalData_options = {
  symbol: "UPBIT:BTCKRW",
  colorTheme: "light",
  isTransparent: false,
  largeChartUrl: "",
  displayMode: "regular",
  width: 480,
  height: 830,
  locale: "kr"
};

const Screener_options = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 600,
  defaultColumn: "moving_averages",
  defaultScreen: "most_volatile",
  market: "korea",
  showToolbar: true,
  colorTheme: "light",

};

</script>
```

I've used the `ref` function to create a reactive reference for the `selectedOption` variable, and I've updated the other variables to use the `const` keyword.

RESPONSE:

The `SameSite` attribute of an HTTP cookie is used to control whether a cookie should be sent in cross-site (or third-party) contexts. It helps protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

To indicate whether a cookie is intended to be set in a cross-site context, you specify the `SameSite` attribute when setting the cookie. There are three possible values for the `SameSite` attribute:

1. `SameSite=None`: This value indicates that the cookie can be sent in cross-site requests. It is typically used for cookies that need to be accessible in cross-origin contexts, such as when embedding content from one domain on another. However, when setting this value, you must also set the `Secure` attribute to ensure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections.

2. `SameSite=Strict`: This value indicates that the cookie should only be sent in same-site requests. It provides the highest level of security and is suitable for most scenarios.

3. `SameSite=Lax`: This value is a more relaxed version of `SameSite=Strict`. It allows cookies to be sent in cross-site requests when the user navigates to the site via a link (GET request) from an external site. It provides some level of protection against CSRF attacks while allowing for some cross-site functionality.

To indicate whether to send a cookie in a cross-site request, the `SameSite` attribute must be set appropriately when the cookie is initially created or modified. If the `SameSite` attribute is not specified, some browsers may default to `SameSite=Lax`, but it's a good practice to explicitly set it to the desired value for security reasons.
