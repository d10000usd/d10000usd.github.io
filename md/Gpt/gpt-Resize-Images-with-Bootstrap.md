RESPONSE:

To resize the images to fit the screen size using Bootstrap in your Vue template, you can make use of the responsive image classes provided by Bootstrap. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <a :href="link">OpenAI Chat</a>
  </div>
  <li>
    <img
      :src="img"
      v-for="img of images"
      :key="img"
      class="img-fluid"
    />
  </li>
</template>
```

In the code above, we added the `class="img-fluid"` to the `<img>` element. This class is a part of Bootstrap and ensures that the image will scale proportionally and resize itself to fit its container.

Make sure you have the Bootstrap CSS framework included in your project for the responsive classes to work properly. You can include it by adding the following line in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```

Remember to replace `4.5.0` with the version of Bootstrap you're using if it's different.

With these changes, your images should be resized responsively based on the screen size.
