RESPONSE:

To update the `naviList` with the files in the `path` directory sorted by their creation time, you can modify your code as follows:

```python
import os
import glob

def update_posts_index():
    path = "/Users/hg/DEV/Web/markdown-sidebar-client/public/md"
    naviList = []

    # Get all files with the .md extension in the specified path
    md_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(path, "**/*.md"), recursive=True)

    # Sort the files by their creation time
    sorted_files = sorted(md_files, key=lambda x: os.path.getctime(x), reverse=True)

    # Add the relative paths of the sorted files to naviList
    for file_path in sorted_files:
        relative_path = file_path.split("public/")[-1]
        naviList.append(relative_path)

    print(naviList)
    return naviList

# Call the function to update the posts index
update_posts_index()
```

Here's an explanation of the changes made:

1. Imported the `glob` module: It simplifies the process of finding files with a specific extension (`*.md` in this case) in a directory.

2. Used `glob.glob` to get all the `.md` files in the `path` directory, including files in subdirectories. The returned `md_files` is a list of file paths.

3. Sorted the `md_files` list based on the creation time of each file using the `key` parameter of the `sorted` function. The `os.path.getctime` function retrieves the creation time of a file.

4. Reversed the sorting order by setting `reverse=True` to get the files in descending order (most recent first).

5. Iterated over the sorted files and added their relative paths to the `naviList` list.

6. Printed the `naviList` and returned it as the final result.

Now, when you call `update_posts_index()`, it will print the `naviList` containing the relative paths of the files in the `path` directory, sorted by their creation time.
