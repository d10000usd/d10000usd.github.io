Virtual script "/Users/hg/DEV/Web/markdown-sidebar-client/src/components/HelloWorld.vue.js" not found, may missing <script lang="ts"> / "allowJs": true / jsconfig.json.v

RESPONSE:

I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I don't have direct access to your local file system or specific project files on your machine. Therefore, I can't find or access the virtual script you mentioned.

However, I can provide some general guidance based on the information you provided. If you're encountering an error stating that the virtual script file "/Users/hg/DEV/Web/markdown-sidebar-client/src/components/HelloWorld.vue.js" is not found, here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Verify the file path: Double-check the file path to ensure that it is correct and matches the location of the file on your machine. Make sure there are no typos or missing directories.

2. Confirm the file existence: Use your operating system's file explorer or command-line tools to confirm that the file actually exists at the specified path. If it doesn't exist, you may need to create it or correct the path reference in your code.

3. Check the file extension: The error message suggests that the file should have a `.js` extension. Ensure that the file you're looking for has the correct extension. If it's a TypeScript file, it should have the `.ts` extension instead.

4. Verify the language configuration: If you're using TypeScript in your project, make sure the script tag in your Vue component is correctly set to `lang="ts"` instead of `lang="js"`. This is necessary for TypeScript files.

5. Check configuration files: If you have a `jsconfig.json` file in your project, ensure that the `"allowJs"` option is set to `true`. This allows JavaScript files to be used in a TypeScript project. However, if you are using TypeScript, it's recommended to rename your file to use the `.ts` extension and update its content to valid TypeScript code.

Remember to consult your project's documentation, the Vue.js documentation, or seek assistance from the development community for more specific help related to your project and configuration files.

const response = await fetch('/src/assets/README.md');

RESPONSE:

The code you provided attempts to fetch a file named `README.md` located in the `/src/assets` directory. However, it seems like you're trying to fetch a local file using a relative URL, which may not work as expected.

In a typical web application, the `fetch` function is used to make HTTP requests to fetch resources from a server. It's not designed to directly access local files on the client-side.

If you want to load the contents of a local file in a Vue.js component, you can import it using the appropriate build tool (such as Webpack) and access its contents as a string. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```javascript
// Import the README.md file as a string
import readmeContent from '@/assets/README.md';

export default {
  async created() {
    // Access the content of the README.md file
    console.log(readmeContent);
  },
};
```

In this example, the `@/assets/README.md` path assumes that your build tool is configured to resolve the `@` alias to the root directory of your project.

Please note that this approach assumes you're using a build tool and bundler like Webpack, and it may not be suitable for all scenarios. If you're trying to load a local file in a different context or have additional requirements, please provide more details so that I can assist you further.
